Ext.require('Ext.chart.*');

/* Several places in the DCT JS do something like this:
		Ext.ComponentMgr.each(function (key, item, itself) {
			if (Ext.isDefined(item.getXType()) && !Ext.isEmpty(item.dctControl)) {
   Basically, iterating through all Components and checking their xtypes. The problem is,
   this picks up items that are Ext.Widget items, which are lightweight Components and
   do not have the getXType() method, so the JS errors out. An example is the numeric axis
   component of a chart. In Platform 6.2.1.1491, this leaves the user unable to use the top nav
   from the Dashboard (where charts are present).
   It seems that the most lightweight solution would be to define getXType for widgets.

Ext.override(Ext.Widget, {
	getXType: function() {
		return "widget"; // hope this is OK. See http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.1/classic/Ext.enums.Widget.html
	}
});
